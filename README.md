This will be the repo I use to learn python.
I do not know where this will take me but I am excited to learn.
I hope to build some kind of a mad libs generator.
#####################################################################

I need to start working on an algorithm for my mad-gen. 

Step 1 will be to print some output to screen that tells the user they
are about to begin a new game. "press enter to begin."

A mad lib should be randomly pulled from a
list or tuple. I dont know which at this point will work better.
It probably doesnt matter.

The mad lib file should have a stored vaule for the number of nouns
adjectives etc the mad lib will need.

Users will be asked for input

completed mad lib will be printed to the screen
