This will be the repo I use to learn python.
I do not know where this will take me but I am excited to learn.
I hope to build some kind of a mad libs generator.
___
* Step 1 will be to print some output to screen that tells the user they
are about to begin a new game. "press enter to begin."

* A mad lib should be randomly pulled from a
list or tuplet containing dictionaries

* the dictionary will contain name of text file where the madlib is stored
a number for verbs, strings, nouns, adjectives, adverbs etc.


* Users will be asked for input
	some nested loops with ask repeatedly from the user to input verbs, nouns etc until
	loops will need to know what they are asking for and how many items they are looking for
	
	input will be stored into empty lists that can be inserted into the final madlib
 
* Completed mad lib will be printed to the screen
	input will ned to be inserted into the correct spot in the text befor it can be printed.
