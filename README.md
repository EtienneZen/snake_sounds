This will be the repo I use to learn python.
I do not know where this will take me but I am excited to learn.
I hope to build some kind of a mad libs generator.
___
* Step 1 will be to print some output to screen that tells the user they
are about to begin a new game. "press enter to begin."

* A mad lib should be randomly pulled from a
list or tuple. I don't know which at this point will work better.
It probably doesn't matter. Etc the mad lib will need.

* Users will be asked for input

* Completed mad lib will be printed to the screen
