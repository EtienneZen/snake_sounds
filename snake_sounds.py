#This is my madlib generator I built for the level1tech 'devember' challange.
#I wanted to learn python and a refresh some basic coding.

#I think I will need to define a class here for the madlibs
# madlib txt should be stored in a seperate file

#begin function that introduces the player to the game and prompts them to begin
#This function will ask the user to hit enter to begin and need to return a random 
#that will be used to pick a madlib later.
def begin():
    print('                                  Welcome to \n')

#intro text will go here    
#i/0 code will go here
#rando lib here

begin() #used for testing
    





#once madlib has been selected a git-word function will need to get input from a user
#This function will need to read what words it needs to git,
#print the name of the varibles it needs from the user and then 
#return the varibles in a list to be inserted later.

#print_lib function will need to insert the correct varibles into the correct location 
#and print the final madlib onto the screen.
